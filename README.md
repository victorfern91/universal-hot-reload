# universal-hot-reload

When I work on my own projects at home I use a lot react and webpack features, and I like very much some plugins in the webpack environment. Especially the hot-reload plugins.

I miss a lot those features at work because every time I save a file I need to reload the web app manually!
That's annoying. I can't refactor every project to React so I built a universal solution for my problem... 
And I publish this to help other people with the same problem.

The first promise I made to myself, before the coding process, was "please do not write in production/development files" so be confident to use this universal plugin.

In some days I will push more features, like sass compiling, etc, etc!

Don't use this until the first release, please! :smile:
